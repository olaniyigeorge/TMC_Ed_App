> ## An education(secondary school) web app built with Django web framework.

#### A project I'm building go get a hang of the Django web framework.

Having taught in a private school in a rural part of Nigeria for a few years, I've noticed some repeated/time wasting issues and strategic flaw that could be easily solved with just the right software application.
Therfore, this project will be a work in progress(hopefully not for long) till I develop solutions that can have meaning/disruptive impact on the educational system of rural Nigeria.


This app allows users(students and/or staff of a secondary school) to;
* create classes, 
* take classes, 
* answer quizzes, 
* view/record results 
* connect teachers to students
and view information on students.
